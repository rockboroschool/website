= Website Backup on Dropbox =

For security of your sites, webs hops or online portals is backup a must. With backup from www.webpage-backup.com you can secure backup and restore all your projects independent if it website or woocommerce shop as to make restoring from your backups. From security reasons it is impotent to schedule your backups, thereby your information or comments from your databases no go lost. Of course the more important for the security are (frequently) backups for woocommerce shops or multisite backups and there one click to restores from your backup drive. The woocommerce backups need more storage in cloud due to large files.<br />
But in most cases it isn't needed to make full backup. With help of our service webpage-backup.com you can select the folder or special databases that you must backup or to backup single website inside your hosting. But for our service it does not matter if the files are large or small, in case of the restoration it is the same. As well as for your local backup. Local backup are done on your hosting. If your hosting have enough space for backup it is ok, but it is not recommended. In most cases for storage your full backup on space of your hosting it is not enough space otherwise it is not safe enough, especially if something happen with your hosting or after some time you want to change your hosting provider. Additional if your make automate schedule backups or data base backups ever after some time the space on your backup drive will be full. For this reason the best is to use the Dropbox storage. Dropbox storage is scalable. Of course the scheduler dropbox backup it is not a must. You can make it manually and for free, but it easy to forget and the danger to lose your backup data are big. You must not to upload your dropbox backup on your PC or desktop you can directly restoring your website from dropbox drive. Independently of our service it is possible to downloading, uploading the data from the dropbox account. By dropbox backup with www.webpage-backup.com you can make exclusions of folders or by restoring import archives or whole bundle of archives. By dropbox backup or wep page cloning or migration of the sites it is important that all folders have permissions to write it is the same how permission to access the folder or to uploading it. For backup on dropbox it is does not matter if your site have ssl certificate or it is normal woocommerce shop without SSL certificate the same goes for migrating or for website clone. For our service www.webpage-backup.com it is important that our servise have permissions to the folders and to backup drive. 

= Special functions =

To the special functions of our website backup doesn’t belong the migration, scheduler backup, cron backup, wpmu backup, shop backup and encryption by cloning, if you make some clone of your website or multisite clone. It is all normal functions of our plugin or service at our website www.webpage-backup.com. The most of this tools are free of charge, especially if you do it manually. But inside our multisite tools are other addons and functions. Addons for your pages or multisite (WPMU) peges you can add inside of your service account if you want.  But for some of this function it is required to register on www.webpage-backup.com. For manage of multisites or just for one page menaging, for cron and scheduled dropbox backup as for full restoration of you WooCommerce shop, website or multisite as well as for migration - to register it is must. It is not possible to do full restoration of website from dropbox backup without the WordPress site self. 

= Easy backup =

By draw up of our dropbox backup tools we try to do the backup or restoring ever for not experts and multisites owners, but with the same tools how for experts. For experts we have Buckup explorer where the expert can select or to do exclusion of files and webpages. As the register user you can use multiple dropbox account or create other multisite buckup drive clouds, how FTP or you can do the local backup on the site of your host. All automatically functions are inside of our service. To automatically tools belong: cron and scheduler, migrator and remote. Scheduled jobs for dropbox you can set in our calendar, it gives overview. 

= Back Up, Cloning, duplicate or migrate of websites =

Cloning, duplicate or migrate in principal all the function a same. It gives you the possibility quickly to create site clone with as “templates” for multiple site.  This clone tool is very useful, if you have more than one website or, if you want to clone or duplicate your web page. With full backup of your old site or WooCommerce shop you can clone or duplicate, and create new clone (due back up) of webshop or website with one click. All multisite backups functions are available from one dashboard of cloning tool, how multisite backup, as well as WPMU backup in the same cloud or in several cloud storages of hosting provider or just server. From same dashboard available clone restorations functions separate or in bundle, depend of your multisite backup settings. If your do so much settings you can remove not needed settings or clone of backup. The settings must be removed separately ever for multisite or clone. The backup dropbox storages must be removed separately too. Although it seems complicated to do automatic backup. With our backup plugin for backup, clone or migrate - you can make it without expert knowledge. Clone add-ons allow your easy backup or migrate your website or WPMU (multisite). "Dropbox backup" is just ultimate tool for WordPress that can worst your productivity by cloning of web pages, allowing you to do efficiently manage of cloned pages through clone or multisite installations.

= Easy data restoring =

From the list you can remove and select appropriate restoring file. In settings your can add or remove the cloud storage. In case of cloning you must restore your old website backup on other webpage. Cloning is the same how resorting but in more steps. The same bee meant for migrating of multisite and shops and there restore. With our file explorer you can match every file separately for restoration. In case of restoration only this files will be restore. You can restore one file than the next, but it easy to make restoring in bundle or directly to recover whole full backup. The restoration time depend from your hosting and upload rate as well as restoration depend from the file size witch must be restore. Scheduled restoring and recovering isn’t possible, unless somebody have special inquiry on our service to do scheduled recovering. The recover from the Dropbox cloud storage take time, depend from the web site size and right permissions of the folders of your hosting provider. 

= Backing Up and Restoration to Dropbox =
= Backup: Yes Or No? =
<p>In the age of trend-setting technologies, information backing up is necessary for many life spheres that are related in any way to creation of something. That refers to programming, site building, engineering, designing, not to mention home data - photos, videos and other stuff. This list can go on and on… One would think, what is so special about this backup thing? Well, the one fact known for sure is that it saves lives of both: different projects and people who fagged away at these very same projects.</p>
<p>It has been said all the time that everyone should make the reserve copy (or backup), but not many actually do that, and besides, there are even those who have no clue about it and what it is for. Nevertheless, information about backup is really an important and useful habit, so let’s know what’s what about it.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s a need to determine the backup process – it is a data redundancy to different storage devices, making copies of the existing data. Now let’s clear its usefulness to each and every. On one hand, modern computers and their hard drives, which are the major and the most popular data storage places, have attained quite dramatic reliability numbers. Multiform redundant coding on different levels of data management provides strong security from the possible sad situations when the information is damaged as a result of accidental error in the act of data saving. But on the second thought, even the most dependable storage mediums sooner or later go down, and for what is more, it usually happens all of the sudden. Now that is the break point, when you finally change your mind upon all the information kept by people on their hard discs. Passwords and contacts, momentous pictures and rare music collections, all possible working data – this whole treasure can disappear without warning from your website, which can turn to serious financial and time losses in addition to emotional stress.</p>
<p>The easiest variant is to simply copy data to another folder on a hard drive. But unfortunately, that is an unreliable decision, because that would release you from only the small number of possible problems, even if this folder is placed on another hardware. Now you are aware that at the present digital information day creating of backup is neither a whim nor extra precaution, this is a plain safety measure.</p>

= What to do if recovering failed? =

First of all check the data spelling. It is most common mistake. Other common mistakes by recovering are: 

* to recover from wrong cloud storage;
* if done alone database back up – not full and you can't see the recover sites;
* by recovering process there was internet connection interrupted;
* In your database are file exclusions;
* your database back up was not consistent;
* file archive of back up with a broken checksum;
* back up or restore from damaged cloud storage or from damaged back up archive;
* misspelled back up due user failed restore;

Large file and big size databases need more time to back up or recover website. It can take until two hours or more, depend from the size of your back up database, but for our recovery service it doesn’t matter for uploading of large files or small files. The difference between recover the large files and small is the time. <br />
After check all of this figures please write an email to our support team http://www.webpage-backup.com and we will try to answer as soon as possible and to give you’re the best solution how easy to recover your site.

If you see some of 5xx error codes, as return of your backup:<br />
please, feel free to contact your own system administrator (admins, support etc.), because this type of errors come from your server.<br />

**The timely backup protects from viruses.**

There are some requirements for creating a reliable backup:<br />
•	Make copies of your files regularly and as often as you can;<br />
•	Rank your data by importance and back up essential information first. Generally, temporary files only add up to the back up volume and carry no significance, so get rid of them;<br />
•	Do not store your file copies on the same hard drives;<br />
•	Make sure you can access your backups any time and from any place;<br />
•	Schedule your backups and ensure you get informed on their status;<br />
•	If your medium capacity or bandwidth is limited use compression tools;<br />
A good solution is to have a separate server for remote backups although it is not fail-safe. If the server is unavailable restoration will be impossible. To ensure high accessibility and data safety use cloud storage services.<br />
There are a lot of services providing free but limited cloud storage capacity for backups like Google Drive, Amazon S3 (AWS) or Dropbox. The problem is they do not support FTP protocol which sometimes is the most adequate way of data transfer. In comparison, virtually every host company supports this protocol.

= Restoration of Backup Files =
<p>Different factors may be the reason for someone to restore his data from a dropbox backup. This is a truly helpful option that supposes bringing the saved data from dropbox storage place back to its original in case you’ve lost or damaged the existing one.</p>
= Best Choice to Keep Data =
<p>Among the available ways to maintain information the first place belongs rightfully to **cloud storages** or **cloud drives**. These are sorts of virtual data storages, that save and manage the data via numerous servers strewn about World Wide Web. Their principle is simple: every ‘cloud’ has definitively stated limit of Gb virtual space, that is given to a new user absolutely for free. But in time, if a person wants to expand it, he’ll have to pay according to price plan. So here we have a simple case of effective advertising – a user gets used to the comfort and mobility of the network repository, and after he concludes that the cloud suits him to the full extend in every meanings, he pays for the “rent” of this sufficiency.</p>
= Dropbox Backup and WordPress =
<p>For the present day Dropbox cloud is still an unbeaten leader that is up to multi-million clients number. Most probably that has to do with the fact that it is Dropbox that stood at the origins of virtual space providing to users, and it is the first company, that has realized the idea of cloud data storage. It works by creation of a virtual folder  in the cloud, where all the info of your wordpress website is saved, the one which you download to your Dropbox folder on your computer. For the WordPress website management the best choice is to download a plugin to easily administrate your source from wordpress admin dashboard.  Backup&Restore Dropbox has many positive reviews and it deals with the performance of backup and restores, both local and dropbox.</p>
<br />
<p>Dropbox Full Backup for WordPress is good for both restore and backups tasks. It allows to use your own App key and App secret in order to keep then private with higher security for yourself. It can be your personal guard that can keep all the files saved and backed up as much as possible, and even in case of your website data lost, you are able to restore all the data just with one click. </p>
<br />
<p>To make a conclusion we’d say, that in order to be safe and sound with any of your data of your WordPress site information you should trouble yourself with backing up of an important information. That will restrict possible damages to minimum and save your time and nerves.</p>

If I do my backup to dropbox it's return this message "Maximum execution time of XXX seconds exceeded" and sometimes some other messages while uploading to dropbox. I've tried to do my backups with some of known WordPress plugins like "BackWPup", "UpdraftPlus Backup and Restoration", "WordPress Backup to Dropbox", "BackUpWordPress" but it's all without success. Can you please advise me after all these failures, why I have to trust in "Dropbox Backup & Restore" plugin? =

OK, this is a complex question, but we'll try to answer this by comparing of  "BackWPup", "UpdraftPlus Backup and Restoration", "WordPress Backup to Dropbox", "BackUpWordPress" with "Dropbox backup & restore" plugin.<br />
All of this backup plugins like "Dropbox backup & restore", "BackWPup", "UpdraftPlus Backup and Restoration", "WordPress Backup to Dropbox" or "BackUpWordPress" has functionality not only for a backup, but also for restoration (restore or restoring process for website).

To automate backup to Dropbox (scheduled backup to Dropbox), please look at settings block of an installed PRO plugin.

Sure, the folder “Dropbox_Backup” with this path on you website hosting or website server "/web1/user/website/XXXXXXXX/wp-content/Dropbox_Backup"  must be created, if this wasn’t created yet<br />
AND this folder must be also writable (For example within permission 777 on this folder).<br />
